Practical examples on English text analysis with [Stanford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/) a Java Library for [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).

All text samples used for testing are Star Trek quotes (English not Klingon) sourced from either [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek) or [Memory Alpha](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Portal:Main). After an entirely unscientific thought process, I decided such quotes are grammatically correct,
adequately diverse and of average complexity.

Won't bore you with grammar or linguistic theory as this is written from a code monkey's rather than a PhD student's perspective. Think Scotty instead of Spock.
