Practical tutorials on how you can use the Kotlin REPL to programmatically manage and modify files and folders. You may want to perform operation on the files itself like copy, move, rename or delete. Simple operations on the file's contents like append or delete lines of text. Perhaps more importantly, invoke a method on each line or other part of the file or store the results of some calculations. The standard functionality coming with Kotlin is enough for such operations, and the API is easy to use from a REPL. Some other external libraries will be employed to parse files in specific formats like JSON.
